Overview
In this project, we are going to build a smart farming sysem using the Internet of Things
Technology. This project will help farmers to maintain their fields without excessive human involvement.
In this method, we will utilize the latest IoT technologies to build a real-time monitoring
system for the farmers. It will provide data such as teemperature, humidity and soil
moisture to the farmers so that the farmers can adjust their field conditions
accordingly.


Purpose
This project will make the daily work farmers much easier as they wouldn't have to travel
to their farms everyday to check and maintain their field. Moreover, this will result in increase quantity and quality of the goods
produced by the farmers.
A huge part of farming is based on predections and guess, which sometimes leads to
huge losses in this sector. Hence, to minimize the use of predections, this model will
provide farmers accurate data.
